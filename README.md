# Intrduction

This repo contains all the exercise and final project I made during the course DV1608 V24 Objektorienterade webbteknologier	given by Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan. The course focuses on object-oriented programming techniques in the PHP programming language. Classic object-oriented designs are handled together with object-oriented programming in a web-based framework along with databases and unit testing.

All the outcomes from each course moment are shown in the menu bar of the index page. Each course moment focuses on a topic
1. Ramverk - Introdction to the framework we use in this course
2. Objektorientering - Introduction to object oriented programming
3. Applikation - A simple application
4. Enhetstestning - Introduction to Unit test
5. ORM/Databas - Introduction to ORM and database
6. Automatiserad test - Introduction to tools for testing
10. Projekt - The final course project

Submenus are shown when you go in to each moment.

__Highlight:__
1. kmom03 is a simple version of card game: Black Jack, aiming for exercizing object oriented programming.
2. kmom04 is a simple exercise on ORM and database. It was trained by manipulating a tiny library database using concept CRUD.
3. kmom06 is a written report on the test results of my web application using different tools and online tools.
4. kmom10 is the final project of the couse, which is a advanced version of the card game: Black Jack. More details can be found inside that page.
